# GildedRose-Java
A lesson-by-lesson Java implementation of the Emily Bache's [Gilded Rose refactoring kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
## Part I: Underlying Principles
### The Four Rules of Simple Design
1. Passes the tests
2. Reveals intent
3. No duplication (DRY)
4. Fewest elements

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### TDD versus Legacy Rescue
- Both driven by Four Rules of Simple Design
- **TDD:** When refactoring, strive for perfection 
- **Legacy Rescue:** "Good is too expensive.  I just want better (quickly)." (Belshee)

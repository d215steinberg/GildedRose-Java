## Part II: Initiating Our Test Bed 
### Lesson #1: Where do we begin?
The code is clearly too obfuscated to change safely, so we need to refactor.  But we cannot safely refactor without test
coverage.  

We begin by discovering what kind of test coverage already exists.  The code base has two test classes:
- [**GildedRoseTest.java**](https://github.com/d215steinberg/GildedRose-Java/blob/startPoint/src/test/java/com/gildedrose/GildedRoseTest.java)
- [**TexttestFixture.java**](https://github.com/d215steinberg/GildedRose-Java/blob/startPoint/src/test/java/com/gildedrose/TexttestFixture.java)

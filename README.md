### Lesson #2: How valuable is a non-automated test
We run **TexttestFixture.java**.  
We verify results manually (takes about a minute).  
We run test coverage (70.0% coverage of **GildedRose.java**).  
This test is not very useful:
- 30% of code is not covered
- We will need to verify results manually after every change

Then again, a 70%-coverage, semi-manual test is better than no test at all.  We will keep this test around until we can render it obsolete.

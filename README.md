### Lesson #9: Failing characterization tests are learning opportunities
We step through the specifications in **GildedRoseRequirements.txt**, capturing each in a test method.  After writing
each new test, we run all the tests to verify that we are still GREEN.
```java
@Test
public void itemHasSpecifiedName() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 0, 0);
    assertThat(getLoneItem().name, is("foo"));
}
```
```
    - All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
```
```java
@Test
public void itemHasSpecifiedSellIn() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 17, 0);
    assertThat(getLoneItem().sellIn, is(17));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```
```
    - All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
```
```java
@Test
public void itemHasSpecifiedQuality() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 0, 19);
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(19));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```
```java
@Test
public void nameRemainsUnchangedAtEndOfDay() {  
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 0, 0);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().name, is("foo"));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```
```
    - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
```
```java
@Test
public void sellInDecreasesAtEndOfDay() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 17, 0);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().sellIn, is(16));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```
```
@Test
public void qualityDecreasesAtEndOfDay() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 0, 19);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(18));
}
```
```diff
- Expected: is <18>
-    but: was <17>
```
This last test surprisingly failed.  We realize that we were using 0 has a sample sell-in value, an unwise choice since a sell-in value of 0 has a special meaning.  We change our sample value, and the test succeeds.

```java
@Test
public void qualityDecreasesAtEndOfDay() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 17, 19);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(18));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```
The **sell-in = 0** case actually represents our next requirement, 
```
    - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
```
so we keep that test as well (with the appropriate name and assertion).

```java
@Test
public void qualityDecreasesBy1AtEndOfDay() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 17, 19);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(18));
}

@Test
public void qualityDecreasesBy2AtEndOfDayOnceSellDateHasPassed() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem("foo", 0, 19);		
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(17));
}
```
```diff
+ GREEN
```

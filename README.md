## Part V: Implementing the change
### Lesson #26: Implementing the new functionality
We now un-ignore our failing Conjured test (**conjuredQualityDecreasesBy2**) in **GildedRoseTest**.  We then implement **ConjuredUpdater.updateQuality** to make the test pass.

We have missed some edge cases, so we write a new test, **conjuredQualityDecreasesBy4OnceSellDateHasPassed**, and we make that pass as well.

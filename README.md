### Lesson #25: All we need is better
We are now faced with a choice.  We have four **ItemUpdater** implementations to create.  Which should we create first?  We could present arguments for each option, but in this case we should create **ConjuredUpdater** first.  Why?  *Because that is all we need to do.*

We test-drive the creation of **ConjuredUpdater** by **ItemUpdaterFactory**.  For now, **ConjuredUpdater** simply extends **DefaultUpdater**.

### Lesson #13: Checking test coverage
We write tests for the Backstage Passes specifications.  

```java
@Test
public void backstagePassesQualityIncreasesBy1MoreThan10DaysFromConcert() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem(BACKSTAGE_PASSES, 11, ARBITRARY_QUALITY);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(ARBITRARY_QUALITY + 1));
}

@Test
public void backstagePassesQualityIncreasesBy2Within10DaysOfConcert() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem(BACKSTAGE_PASSES, 10, ARBITRARY_QUALITY);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(ARBITRARY_QUALITY + 2));
}

@Test
public void backstagePassesQualityIncreasesBy3Within5DaysOfConcert() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem(BACKSTAGE_PASSES, 5, ARBITRARY_QUALITY);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(ARBITRARY_QUALITY + 3));
}

@Test
public void backstagePassesQualityDropsToZeroOnceConcertHasPassed() {
    app = createAppWithSingleItem(BACKSTAGE_PASSES, 0, ARBITRARY_QUALITY);
    app.updateAtEndOfDay();
    assertThat(getLoneItem().quality, is(0));
}
```
We have now written tests for each bullet item in the requirements.  Now we check our coverage.

We still have an uncovered block of two lines and several uncovered branches.  We need a few more tests.
